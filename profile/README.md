# Computational Toxicology Research Group  
Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau (EHSRB)  
Environmental and Radiation Health Sciences Directorate (ERHSD)  
Health Canada

## Overview
Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the Computational Toxicology Research Group, led by Dr. Kristin Eccles, within the Exposure and Biomonitoring Division of the Environmental Health Science and Research Bureau (EHSRB) at Health Canada. We operate under the Environmental and Radiation Health Sciences Directorate (ERHSD), a science-driven branch within Health Canada that integrates environmental and radiation health research, chemical surveillance, emergency preparedness, and science policy. Here, our group develops computational tools, pipelines, and workflows to support the evaluation and regulation of chemical substances with the ultimate goal of protecting human health and the environment. We focus on advancing and applying New Approach Methods (NAMs), such as omics-based assays and high-throughput phenotypic profiling (HTPP), to modernize toxicity testing under the [Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-15.31/).

## Mission
Our work is aligned with Health Canada’s broader commitment to:
* Reduce the negative health impacts of environmental exposures on the Canadian population, particularly among groups that are disproportionately affected.
* Advance scientific methods that replace, reduce, or refine (3Rs) the use of vertebrate animal testing.
    * Read more the Health Canada & Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Strategy for Vertebrate Animal Testing Reduction, available [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/canadian-environmental-protection-act-registry/implementing-modernized-cepa/strategy-replace-reduce-refine-vertebrate-animal-testing.html).
* Support regulatory decision-making through robust, transparent, and reproducible computational toxicology approaches.
* We contribute to the scientific foundation of regulatory programs, including the [Chemicals Management Plan (CMP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/chemical-substances/chemicals-management-plan.html).

## What We Do
* Develop computational pipelines for analyzing data from NAMs such as:
    * High-throughput phenotypic profiling (HTPP)
    * Omics-based assays
* Contribute to risk assessment by integrating exposure, hazard, and mechanistic data.
* Advance alternative testing strategies by collaborating with national and international partners to:
    * Identify and prioritize NAMs for regulatory applications.
    * Generate, standardize, and analyze toxicological data.
    * Promote FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusable) and harmonized data-sharing across regulatory bodies.
* Support computational analysis across ERHSD and other directorates in the Healthy Environments and Consumer Safety Branch.

## Repository Structure
This GitHub organization hosts:
* Codebases for computational toxicology tools and pipelines
* Notebooks and scripts for NAM data processing and visualization
* Documentation and user guides
* Example datasets (where publicly releasable)

## Collaboration & Engagement
We are committed to:
* Open science and reproducibility.
* Collaboration with regulators, researchers, and stakeholders in Canada and abroad.
* Continuous improvement and innovation in computational toxicology methods.
